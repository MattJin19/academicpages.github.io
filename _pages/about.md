Bienvenido, Welcome to Yuanzhe's Homepage! 
======
I am a Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Oxford, working as a postgraduate research assistant at the Oxford e-Research Centre (OeRC) with Professor Min Chen. My current work focuses on quality assurance in machine learning applications which combines human and machine strengths in the machine learning model training and testing process. I am also an invited editor for Springer, IEEE Access, and a student member of IEEE Region 10(Asian-Pacific) and ACM SIGCHI. 

My research interests include: 
 * Machine Learning
 * Visualization
 * Intelligent User Interface
 * Model Quality Assurance

Previously, I was a master's student at Northwestern University in the USA working on applying machine learning applications in embedded systems and autonomous driving.
