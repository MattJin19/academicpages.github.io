I am an MS student majoring in Computer Engineering at Northwestern University, working as a research assistant in IDEAS Lab. My current work is using machine learning methods to predict the behavior of autonomous vehicles in different traffic scenarios including ramp merging, intersection and platooning. I am also an invited editor for Springer and IEEE Access. <br>
My research interests include: 
 * Machine Learning
 * Quality Assurance
